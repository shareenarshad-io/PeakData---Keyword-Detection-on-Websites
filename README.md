PeakData Data Science Project

Your task is to create an algorithm, that takes html page as input and infers if the page contains the information about cancer tumorboard or not. What is a tumor board? Tumor Board is a consilium of doctors (usually from different disciplines) discussing cancer cases in their departments. If you want to know more please read this article.

The expected result is a CSV file for test data with columns [doc_id and prediction].
